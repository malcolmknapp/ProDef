Product Definition Lexer

:::Introduction
The Product Definition Lexer is for automatically formating and folding a
product definition document so it is easier to read. This make it possible to
use a text file to store all the whole product definition. This in turn allows
the use of all the tools that are available for code, i.e version control,
branching, diffs, etc for design documents.

This lexer handles the formating and color of Product Definition documents.
Product Defintion documents are meant to be structured enough that they can be
programmatically parsed but also human readable. These document treat everything
as a string and uses various transition words to signal the chnages between
formatting states
